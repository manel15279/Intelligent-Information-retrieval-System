Renewable energy stands as a pivotal solution in addressing the global climate crisis, with impressive numbers supporting its significance.

Types of Renewable Energy:

Solar Energy: The solar industry is booming, with a cumulative installed capacity exceeding 760 GW globally in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Wind Energy: Wind power is a major player, accounting for approximately 8% of the world's electricity generation in 2020, as reported by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).

Hydropower: Hydropower remains a dominant force, providing over 16% of the world's electricity in 2018, as per the International Hydropower Association (IHA).

Geothermal Energy: The geothermal sector, while smaller, continues to grow steadily, with the potential to provide substantial baseload energy.

Biomass Energy: Biomass remains a versatile source, with estimates suggesting it could contribute up to 60 GW of renewable energy globally.

Advantages of Renewable Energy:

Reduced Carbon Emissions: Renewable energy sources contributed to a 2.6% reduction in global CO2 emissions in 2020, says the IEA.

Job Creation: The renewable energy sector employed over 12 million people worldwide in 2019, as reported by the Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Review.

Economic Benefits: The U.S. invested $55.5 billion in renewable energy in 2020, driving economic growth and innovation.
